This repository contains the implementation of the Zero-Shot Facade Material Segmentation workflow for urban microclimate research. This workflow leverages state-of-the-art zero-shot learning models to segment and classify building facade materials across diverse urban environments. The primary goal is to assess how facade material choices influence urban heat island effects and outdoor thermal comfort, providing a scalable tool for large-scale urban material mapping.
